#Lab 1 - Setting up the environment.
In this exercise, we will be setting up the environment and all the tools required.

It assumes you are running Linux or MacOS, although it is possible to configure on Windows too.

If you are in a Pivotal workshop and don't want to install and configure these tools in your laptop, ask for the VM which has all required tools already installed.

## git install
## Cloud Foundry account creation
## Cloud Foundry CLI
## Orgs and spaces
